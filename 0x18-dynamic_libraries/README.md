OOHHH! Well i usually see .dll when i was using windows and never knew it stands for DYNAMIC LINKED LIBRARIES and when i started using Linux they are on the OS as SHARED OBJECTS AKA .so

Dynamic libraries are very crucial in the world of modularity and projects where size of executable matters.

These libraries are Loaded in the memory so when they are needed only the memory address is copied instead of a whole bunch of binary codes like it is in Static libraries.

0x18. C - Dynamic libraries
